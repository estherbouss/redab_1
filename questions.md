Answers:
    2. we can see that for the last test, it takes more than 4 minutes to run the program. So we can imagine that
    going through lists of millions of elements is just not realizable, since it would just take far too much
    time for a program to be acceptable.
    
    
    3. Numpy arrays run much faster than the classic 'list' data structure native in Python. 
    Here, arrays being only filled with numbers, a numpy array is a good option. And we can see that the program 
    runs much faster that with the data structure implemented at the beginning.
